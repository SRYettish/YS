           <p class="post-text">When you look at the night sky, you may notice that some stars shine more brightly than others. The brightness of a star is related to how much energy it puts out, as well as how close it is to Earth.
      <br><br> Stars also vary in color - because they vary in temperature. Hotter stars appear blue or white, while cooler stars look orange or red. <br> Astronomers use these characteristics to classify main sequence stars into categories by color and temperature: <br> O (blue) <br> B (blue-white) <br> A (white) <br> F (yellow-white) <br> G (yellow) <br> K (orange) <br> M (red) <br> from hottest and biggest to coolest and smallest. Stars at the ends of their lives are out of the main sequence. These include supergiants, red giants, and white dwarfs.
