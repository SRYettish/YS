Ultra-hot 'Super-Earth' Could Have No Atmosphere: Astronomers often discover and study exoplanets by observing how much light the planets block out as they pass in front of their host stars, a technique known as the "transit method." GJ 1252 b, an exoplanet about 65 light-years away with a radius 1.18 times larger than Earth, was discovered with this method by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in 2020. Astronomers in this new study observed the exoplanet with the Spitzer Space Telescope before it retired and were able to get a closer look at the planet and its atmosphere.
            Astronomers searching for signs of life in the cosmos focus on a number of different details in exoplanets. Many of these details serve as a comparison between the exoplanet and Earth, as Earth remains the only planet where we have confirmed the presence of life.
            
            GJ 1252 b isn't much larger than Earth, but it is much hotter as it is closer to its star and, as astronomers have found in this study, is lacking much of an atmosphere.
            
            “We're just beginning to learn how often, and under what circumstances, rocky planets can keep their atmospheres,” said astronomer and study co-author Laura Kreidberg, the director of the Atmospheric Physics of Exoplanets APEx Department at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. “This measurement is an indication that for the hottest planets, it's unlikely that thick atmospheres typically survive.”
            
            To determine what the exoplanet's atmosphere (if there is one) could be like, astronomers measured infrared radiation from GJ 1252 b as its light was obscured during a secondary eclipse. These observations revealed the planet's scorching day-side temperature, which is estimated to reach as high as 2,242 degrees Fahrenheit (1228 degrees Celsius). In fact, GJ 1252 b is so hot that gold, silver, and copper would all melt on the planet.
            
            The exoplanet's expected temperatures, when compared to atmospheric models, suggest that it likely has a surface pressure of less than 10 bar (for reference, Earth's surface pressure is approximately 1 bar.) While the planet's sizzling hot temperatures would make it difficult for an atmosphere to be stable for long, it is possible that this exoplanet could have an atmosphere with a density like Earth's, an atmosphere up to 10 times denser than Earth's, or even no atmosphere whatsoever.
            
            Given its extreme temperatures and low surface pressure, the astronomers on this team have predicted that GJ 1252 b likely has no atmosphere at all. This is currently the smallest exoplanet for which scientists have such a clear idea of its atmosphere.
