           <p class="post-text">Two planets about as massive as Earth orbit a red-dwarf star only 16 light-years away - nearby in astronomical terms. The planets, GJ 1002 b and c, lie within the star's habitable zone, the orbital distance that could allow liquid water to form on a planet's surface if it has the right kind of atmosphere.
            An international team led by Alejandro Suárez Mascareño of the University of La Laguna, Spain, discovered the two new planets using radial velocity measurements - that is, detecting the “wobbles” of the parent star caused by gravitational tugs from orbiting planets. As the planets move toward the far side of the star, they pull the star away from us, causing the star's light to shift toward the red end of the spectrum. As the planets move toward the star's near side, they pull the star in our direction, shifting its light toward the blue. The planetary tugs on GJ 1002 are tiny, about 4.3 feet (1.3 meters) per second - equivalent to moving at about 3 miles per hour (4.8 kilometers per hour). Such small movements are difficult to detect.
            
            The radial velocity method, which also reveals how massive the planets are, has yielded more than 1,000 confirmed detections of exoplanets. The most detections, however, have been notched using the “transit” method - watching for a tiny dip in starlight as a planet crosses in front of its star - with nearly 4,000 confirmed detections.
            
            To make its radial velocity measurements, the science team relied on instruments called spectrographs, which measure variations in light. The spectrographs used to discover GJ 1002 b and c were part of two collaborative observation programs: The Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO), and the Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M-dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Échelle Spectrographs (CARMENES).
