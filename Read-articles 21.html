           <p class="post-text">The planet, likely rocky but 40% larger than Earth, came to light during follow-up observations of its sister planet, LP 890-9 b. Both fall into the super-Earth category - exoplanets, or planets around other stars, that are up to 75% larger than our own but believed to be rocky worlds, like Earth. Surface conditions might or might not be similar.
        <br> <br>   Both planets orbit a comparatively cool, red-dwarf star, LP 890-9, about 98 light-years away. The inner planet, discovered using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), is about 30% larger than Earth and, with an estimated temperature of 253 degrees Fahrenheit (123 Celsius), probably too hot to be habitable. The outer planet, though possibly chilly by human standards at an estimated 30 Fahrenheit (minus 1.1 Celsius), sits within its star's habitable zone, the orbital distance where liquid water might be present on the surface. This planet was detected using a ground-based telescope survey, the Search for habitable Planets EClipsing Ultra-cOOl Stars (SPECULOOS). The observations not only met their original goal - confirming the existence of the innermost planet - but unexpectedly discovered a second planet in the system.
            
        <br> <br>    Plenty of caveats come with the temperature estimates. The planets' actual temperatures depend on their atmospheres, about which nothing is yet known. It's possible that the outermost planet's atmosphere has given rise to a runaway greenhouse effect, which would make it more like Venus than Earth - much too hot for habitability. Both planets orbit their stars tightly: a “year” on planet b, once around the star, takes only 2.7 days, planet c 8.5 days. But the star is far smaller and cooler than our Sun, placing closely orbiting planet c near the inner edge of this star's habitable zone.
