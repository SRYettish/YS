           <p class="post-text">First they rolled in one by one, those newly discovered planets, like billiard balls pushed across a table.
            Counting them was easy.
            Then they came in handfuls. Still quite manageable; as ground-based observatories began to pile up their discoveries of exoplanets - planets around other stars - in the 1990s and early 2000s, astronomers had no trouble keeping a running tally.
            But when discoveries of exoplanets began to flow from space-based telescopes, it was like a pool shark making a big, smashing break. The billiard balls raced across the table in bunches. In just a few years, scientists were racking up new planets by the thousands.
            And it wasn't just the number, but the types of planets that had to be accounted for. Hot Jupiters, gas giants, rocky, Earth-sized worlds, “super Earths”; hints of potentially frozen, scalding, lava-choked, icy, steamy or watery planets.
