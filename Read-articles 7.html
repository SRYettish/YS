           <p class="post-text">It's one of the most commonly used celestial yardsticks, the distance light travels in one year. Light zips along through interstellar space at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second (more than 66 trips across the entire United States, in one second). Multiply that by all the seconds in one year, and you get 5.8 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers). Just for reference, Earth is about eight light minutes from the Sun. A trip at light speed to the very edge of our solar system - the farthest reaches of the Oort Cloud, a collection of dormant comets way, way out there - would take about 1.87 years. Keep going to Proxima Centauri, our nearest neighboring star, and plan on arriving in 4.25 years at light speed. If you could travel at light speed. Which, unless you're a photon (a particle of light), you can't, and, by current physics, might never be possible.</p>
